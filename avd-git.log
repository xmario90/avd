Ok Daniel-san...you want to sync changes up to your github repo or sync the repo to your server?

Daniel-san currently:
you are working in the following directory ---> /home/tardis/avd
you are working with the following git repo --> https://github.com/xmario90/avd.git

Selection: 1

= We will follow the three-step "Shipping Department" process: =============================================

1. git add -A (Packing the Box): You are walking through the entire warehouse (the /home/tardis/avd folder),
                                 and putting every changed or new file into a box. The box stays on the floor on Lab2.

2. git commit -m "Your Message Here" (Sealing and Labeling): You tape the box shut and write a description on the outside.
                                                              This saves the change to your local history on Lab2.

3. git push (Loading the Truck): This is the final synchronization. You are physically sending that labeled box.
                                 Over the internet to the GitHub warehouse!

============================================================================================================
