1. [1m[33mgit add -A(B[m (Packing the Box): You are walking through the entire warehouse (the /home/tardis/avd folder),
                                 and putting every changed or new file into a box. The box stays on the floor on Lab2.

2. [1m[33mgit commit -m "Your Message Here"(B[m (Sealing and Labeling): You tape the box shut and write a description on the outside.
                                                              This saves the change to your local history on Lab2.

3. [1m[33mgit push(B[m (Loading the Truck): This is the final synchronization. You are physically sending that labeled box.
                                 Over the internet to the GitHub warehouse!
